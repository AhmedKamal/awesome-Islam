This aims to be a unified listing for all the trust worthy islamic website based on different sources.

Islamic Websites (Based on http://bilalphilips.com/islamic-websites/)

The internet provides a sea of knowledge. With such vast information available at our fingertips, it can get difficult and confusing to filter out authentic Islamic websites from the rest. Since a vast majority of Muslims and non Muslims turn to the World Wide Web to research and learn more about the various aspects of Islam, making sure people read things that are in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah rather than falling prey to deviant websites is of utmost importance.
With this issue in mind, a group of my student researchers were directed to compile a list authentic Islamic websites on a rating scale of 1-10 with a review of each website, to help you understand better.

Criteria used in rating the sites:

Authenticity of material and closeness to the Qur’aan, Sunnah & understanding of the Salaf us Saalih.
Quality of the material in terms of language, referencing to the sources and in the case of Ahadeeth, referencing to books of Ahadeeth verification.
Quantity of material put up on the site
Presence of downloadable multimedia content (free downloads get a higher rating)
Audio content
Video content
Any other type like Flash presentations, PowerPoint etc
Presence of streaming multimedia content (lower rating than downloadable multimedia)
Presence of downloadable complete E books (free downloads get a higher rating)
Presence of downloadable Islamic software (free downloads get a higher rating)
Frequency of site updates
If site has a general name like Islam.com or islamweb.com then it has been reviewed with the expectation that it would cover many aspects of Islam and would have a good quantity of varied content matter. The rating reflects the extent to which the site meets these expectations along with the aforementioned criteria.
If the site has a name which specifies one or more aspects of Islam e.g. understandquran.com or a clearly stated aim then it has been reviewed to see how well the specified aspect/ aspects or stated aim are covered along with the aforementioned criteria and the absence of other topics is not reflected in the rating.
Authenticity of material and sticking close to the Qur’aan, Sunnah & understanding of the Salaf us Saalih.
Quality of the material in terms of language, referencing to the sources, and in case of Ahadeeth referencing to books of Ahadeeth verification.
Quantity of material put up on the site.

1. Sunnah Online www.sunnahonline.com/main.htm

Rating 9.5/10

It has almost everything you could ask for in an Islaamic site viz. articles, e books, audio lectures, Qur’aanic Recitations, and even two online Magazines!! The site has a no-frills, plain, businesslike look. The main categories are easy to navigate to but for the subcategories no links are provided. You have to scroll down the page of the main category to find the sub categories. The site also hosts two online magazines (albeit old issues). It only loses out on the look of the site which the webmaster would do well to change keeping in pace with current trends.

Best Feature:

Feature packed site with audios, Qur’aan recitations (even some recitation by Shaikh Albanee!) issues of two online magazines and E books.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

It would be better if under each main category a list of sub categories (with links) is provided to facilitate navigation. Also such a good site should have an attractive look and the latest forms of multimedia content so as to catch the attention of casual visitors.
2. Islam QA.com http://www.islam-qa.com

Rating 9.5/10

Need to look up a Fatwa? Go to Islam QA to find answers to various issues.
The site says: The responses are handled by Sheikh Muhammad Salih al-Munajjid, using only authentic, scholarly sources based on the Quran and sunnah, and other reliable contemporary scholarly opinions. References are provided where appropriate in the responses.
And that’s an accurate synopsis. A lot of effort has been put in by the site maintainers with the questions neatly sorted into categories and sub categories. It also has a site search facility. It contains in excess of 7000 Q&A!! Amazingly the site is available in 7 languages & the English translation is of high quality. What make this site truly worth visiting are the diligently provided references to almost all the Ahadeeth and opinions of the earlier and contemporary scholars. The site accepts questions on line once a month.

It also contains downloadable E-books authored by Shaikh Saalih al Munajjid.

Best Feature:

The huge compilation of Fataawa with an arrangement and search facility that makes it easy to find what you want.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Voice Fataawa. Also the site owners should add a facility for downloading the fataawa base in an easy format. (See what fatwa-online.com has done as an e.g.) Otherwise as per the apparent aim and name of the site it fulfils the job perfectly.
3. Understand Islaam: http://www.understand-islam.net/

Rating 9/10

This is the website of Dr. Saleh as Saleh. It contains safe, sound, authentic Islaamic info. There are plenty of audio downloads and a medium sized book collection. A Study Program is also available complete with online tests.

Best feature:

The study program and a lot of translated works of Shaikh Uthaymeen from one of his own students.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Books and lectures from more Scholars.
4. Fatwa Online.com http://www.fatwa-online.com/

Rating 9/10

Here’s another good Fataawa site. It has an off-the-beaten-track design (though not very attractive), good lectures, fataawa and an innovative form of E books (Compiled HTML help files). Using this they compiled the entire translation of Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan (v 1.36) into 822 Kb which is very convenient to take on a floppy or mail it to someone etc. However they have removed it from their site and replaced it with version 2.2 which includes the Arabic text and footnotes (19.3 Mb). Also they compile their entire fatwa base in the same format at intervals and put it up for download, something I appreciate very much.

Best Feature:

The CHtml fataawa base, CHtml books, information boxes which come up on particular terms with mouse rollover (no need to click) and audio biographies of various contemporary Mashaayikh.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Audio fataawa. Also the webmaster should increase the quantity of E books and introduce English audio lectures dealing with specific Islaamic topics other than biographies.
5. Islam Way.com (English) http://english.islamway.com/

Rating 9/10

For sheer variety of content format Islamway.com beats all other sites that we know of hands down. (Islamweb comes a close second) It has articles, E books, lectures & flash animations. It has the translation of the Holy Qur’aan in PDF with audio embedded in it!!! (the download didn’t work for me but maybe that’s because I have a dial up connection) Not enough? It has the recitation of the entire Qur’aan in Arabic along with the English Translation (Saheeh International) ayah by ayah. All the aforementioned are for free download.
In short Islamway.com has good quality and quantity content for Muslims & non Muslims.

Best Feature:

the Downloadable audio translation of the Qur’aan and the PDF version with audio.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Advanced level articles and books on Aqeedah etc. for those already in Islaam. For e.g. under the category Fundamental Beliefs, the only articles posted are:
Allah is Beautiful & Loves Beauty
Shahada
6. Islam Web.net http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/MainPage/indexe.php

Rating 9/10

For an accurate and honest description about this site and its aims I recommend going to their ‘About Us’ page. The site is exactly what it claims to be.
The site developers have done a really good job in giving the site a modern, polished look and layout. It is easy to surf, has good articles, books, audios and dawah material. The variety of content format is beaten only by Islamway.com (among the sites that I know of).

It also shares with Islamway.com the problem of not having any advanced study material.

Best Feature:

Sleekly designed site with all forms of content.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Advanced level articles and books on Aqeedah etc. for those already in Islaam.
7. Islam House.com http://www.islamhouse.com

Rating 9/10

This site is worth its name. It is a veritable store house of E books and lectures. It has relatively low article content, but the quantity of books and lectures (in multiple languages) makes up for it. The site itself is not among the easily navigable ones and takes a bit of getting adjusted to. It also features Qur’aan translation in many languages although some of the links were not working at the time of the review. We have notified the webmaster and hopefully the links will be restored.

Best Feature:

A solid collection of lectures by many speakers & Qur’aan translation in many languages.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Articles, and a more easier organization of the navigational links would be appreciated.
8. 877-Why-Islam.org http://www.whyislam.org/

Rating 9/10

This is one well planned and laid out Da’wah site. What is striking is that the organizers, ICNA have gone to great lengths to provide all possible opportunities for non Muslims to interact, discuss and ask questions. A flash advertisement right on the home page proclaims, “Call 877, Ask a Question, Visit a Local Mosque, Correspond via E Mail.” So the organization has provided a toll free number, an email, a page on the site for posting questions and a forum for discussion. What more could one ask for? Plus it has some good Da’wah material in the form of articles. There is also a facility for ordering free literature. All in all, a great Da’wah effort.

Best Feature:

The multiple facilities given for Non Muslims to interact, discuss and ask questions on Islaam.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

There is no audio or video content here. In current times there are many people who would rather listen to an audio lecture or see a video than read an article. Besides there is a wealth of such work available from da’ees around the world.
9. Muslim Heritage.com http://www.muslimheritage.com/

Rating 9/10

Here is a site which has filled a requirement on the net about an aspect of Islaam which has either been left out totally or touched on briefly by other sites. What’s more the webmaster has managed to present the material in a very user-friendly and interesting format.
From the site:

Welcome to the new MuslimHeritage.com website, a community and non-profit initiative aimed at providing an educational forum to present and discuss the contribution of Muslim Heritage to present day Science, Technology and Civilisation.

We are currently working on developing a new version of the website and we value your feedback and constructive suggestions. The new version will contain many more exciting interactive features including 3D time-lines, interactive maps and streaming videos.

Hope they put up the new version soon.

Best Feature:

The interactive tour map of Muslim Personalities, Major Cities, Institutions, Discoveries etc.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

What is needed here has already been noted and put on the pipeline by the webmaster as noted above.
10. Audio Islam.com http://www.audioislam.com

Rating 9/10

This site is what it name proclaims, a place to get audios on Islaam. It has a lot of beneficial lectures.

Best Feature:

A good collection of audio lectures

What it lacks/ What could be added:

No other content apart from audio, but that is in keeping with the name of the site
11. Aswat al-Islam.net http://www.aswatalislam.net

Rating 8/10

Although in terms of quantity of audio and video content Aswat al-Islam is to the best of our knowledge unrivalled it loses marks on account of having the authentic and inauthentic bundled up together. Surfer discretion is advised for some of the speakers on the site.

Best Feature:

The large collection of audios and videos.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

A filtering system to weed out the inauthentic stuff.
12. Call to Islam.com www.calltoislam.com

Rating 8/10

When initially reviewed this site had a rating of 7. But it has grown handsomely to reach a rating of 8.5. With the passage of time and addition of more content this site could very well reach the top. Go here for good articles, audio, e- books and live Pal Talk classes.

Best Feature:

A modern, well laid out, easy to navigate site with a good collection of lectures

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The e books section could be strengthened and other forms of multimedia content added.
13. Madinah Arabic.com http://www.madinaharabic.com/Index.htm

Rating 8/10

Spruce up your Arabic! As the site says: This site has been designed to teach the Arabic language based on one of the most popular courses being used today – the Madinah Book Series by Dr V Abdur Rahim which is used by Madinah University to teach English speaking students the Arabic language.
The site is easy to navigate, the courses free and well planned and there is an online bookshop for buying books and CDs for learning Arabic. A students’ Forum has also been provided.

Best Feature:

You guessed it! But no prizes for that one

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Sound files for the Arabic alphabets, a feature which is provided for he sentences later on but not for the alphabets themselves. Plus the site could develop some interactive multimedia for teaching Arabic.
14. Islam Basics.com http://www.islambasics.com/

Rating 8/10

This site would be best described as an E Library. It has lots (really lots) of downloadable books and all for free. Most are in multiple formats. What’s more, this site allows you to do an online search throughout all the books listed at the same time.

Best Feature:

The largest number of downloadable E books in a single site (among the sites that I know of).

What it lacks/ What could be added:

As the site state clearly that their intention in setting up this site is only to put up E books, nothing can be said here for the site. But we would like to advise visitors to the site to support he site by posting their comments on and reviews of the bookd to help newcomers select from this big collection of books
15. Islam Yesterday, Today & Always.com

15. http://www.islamtomorrow.com/

16. Al Sunnah.com http://www.al-sunnah.com

Rating 8/10

This is quite similar to islamworld.net in that it is basically a collection of links to good content available elsewhere on the net. This site nicely complements islamworld.net because it has some additional features.

Best feature:

Excellent collection of links.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

As a link page it doesn’t lack anything besides the possibility of frequent updating and removal of dead links.
17. Sultan.org http://www.sultan.org

Rating 8/10

This is yet another links page which is also the result of a lot of patient hard work on the part of the webmaster.

Best feature:

Excellent collection of links.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

As a link page it doesn’t lack anything besides the possibility of frequent updating and removal of dead links.
18. MSA of USC http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/

Rating 8/10

The site describes itself as a ‘Compendium of Muslim Texts’ and it’s a fitting description.
The site is neatly divided into categories and sections and each section is full of relevant information. It has an online Hadeeth and Qur’aan search that was highly valued at the time it was introduced and several other sites linked to it. With the advent of programs enabling installation of Hadeeth books with search programs on PCs this feature has lost some of its former glory.

Another thing to look out for in this website is the excellent brief introductions that have been written for each category. Just read the introduction on the first page describing Islaam to see what I am talking about.

Best Feature:

Good collection of texts for a serious study of Islaam. In fact this site gives content of a depth which few other sites do. Important terms are html linked throughout the site to articles or glossary items wherever relevant so that a beginner starting at any page on the site can easily get more information.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

It lacks and needs to add audios & multimedia and also increase its store of E books.
19. Islaam.net http://www.islaam.net/main/

Rating 8/10

This is a very good site having a fine collection of article & lectures. Although recommended basically for Muslims intending to learn more about their deen it does contain some comparative religion material. The layout of the site is clean and easy to navigate.

Best feature:

An excellent collection of Qur’aanic recitations by various recitors. Be sure to check out the CD quality (128 Kbps) recitation by Muhammad al Minshawi. It’s worth downloading.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Downloadable E books.
20. Understand Quran http://www.understandquran.com

Rating 8/10

‘Understand the Quran Easy Way’ is the slogan of this website. The site has an easy to use interface and a highly motivating preface is sure to propel you further into the site.
The aim of the site as stated on the home page is:

Welcome to the site dedicated to help us all learn and understand the Holy Quran using easy, efficient, and effective techniques

To achieve this, the maintainers have put in a lot of good effort which is really useful for English, Urdu and Hindi speaking Muslims. The materials available on the site include:
a. A simplified course ‘Understand Qur’aan – the Easy Way ‘
b. Word-for-word translations
c. Audio translation files for a few last Soorahs of Qur’aan
d. Word-for-word translations of daily recitations
e. Dictionaries of Qur’aan in four different languages
f. Simplified 2-page set of Tajweed rules for beginners
g. A useful reference list (80% words of the Qur’aan)

The last is a list of words about which the author says: “The words given in this booklet account for 82.6% (64282) of the total words (approx.77800) of the Holy Qur’an.”
This list and the course are really useful. Do try them out.

Best Feature:

The concept and techniques of understanding the Qur’aan in an easy way.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

It is my du’aa that some Muslim software developers lend their skills to this project to make a good software program which would bring together all the techniques of this site in an attractive multimedia format.
21. – 31. The Faith Network

21. http://imaan.net/

22. http://www.seerah.net/

23. Islam 101.com http://islam101.com/

Rating 8/10

Islam 101 aims to be an educational site on Islam, its way of life, civilization and culture and succeeds to a large extent.
It touches on many aspects of Islaam from Islamic Theology to Human Relations to Comparative Religion and even goes on to provide ‘Islamic perspectives on contemporary issues. Disciplines such as Archeology, Health, Human Rights, History, Islamic Art, Islam and Science, Sociology and Islam and Women are included.’

However there are only articles here, whereas supplementing these topics with relevant books and audio/video lectures would have increased the benefit

What bring up the merit of this site are the online courses and multiple choice tests with instant scoring results. The course and tests are good for new Muslims, non Muslims willing to really understand Islaam and as a refresher in basics for Muslims. The only drawback is that the results do not indicate which answers were wrong (yes I tried the course!)

Best Feature:

Topics not usually dealt with by other sites and the online course + tests.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

E books and multimedia content.
24. Muhammad.net http://muhammad.net/

Rating 8/10

Muhammad.net has just what it suggests i.e. information about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), his life and message. The target audience seems basically to be non-Muslims esp. Christians, although deeper in the site there is some material for those already in Islaam like Ahmed von Denfer’s Uloom al Qur’aan. It’s a good place for new comers to start their search for knowledge about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Once their appetite is whetted, those who want in depth knowledge should proceed to other sources like the biography The Sealed nectar written by Shaikh Safi ur Rahman Mubarakpuri available on line on several sites.
The site also has some good general material on Islaam and the Qur’aan and some audio files of Qur’aanic recitation.

Best Feature:

A full site dedicated to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Detailed works on the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
25. The Gospel of Barnabas http://barnabas.net/

Rating 8/10

The introduction on the website says it all:
The Gospel of Barnabas was accepted as a Canonical Gospel in the Churches of Alexandria till 325 C.E. In 325 C.E., the Nicene Council was held, where it was ordered that all original Gospels in Hebrew script should be destroyed. An Edict was issued that any one in possession of these Gospels will be put to death. The article, How the Gospel Survived, gives a brief narrative on the text’s survival.

An Islamic perspective and commentary are added to each chapter of the Gospel. The commentary highlights any differences or commonalities which exist between the Gospel and the primary Islamic texts, especially the Holy Quran.

Another feature I liked is that they have provided the entire Gospel in a downloadable Word format. So it can become a handy tool for da’ees to print and give to truth seeking Christians

Best Feature:

The Gospel of Barnabas itself and its downloadable Word version.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The content is in keeping with the name of the site especially as the site belongs to a group of sites where each site is dedicated to a specific topic.
26. Crusades.org http://crusades.org/

Rating 8/10

An excellent site on the Crusades from an Islaamic and historical perspective.

Best Feature:

The history of the Crusades and Salahuddin’s service to Islaam

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The content is in keeping with the name of the site especially as the site belongs to a group of sites where each site is dedicated to a specific topic.What it lacks/ What could be added: The content is in keeping with the name of the site especially as the site belongs to a group of sites where each site is dedicated to a specific topic.
27. About Tajweed.com http://www.abouttajweed.com/

Rating 8/10

For those non Arabs wanting to learn or improve their Tajweed here’s a very good resource. It explains in systematic detail the rules and application of The Tajweed rules for Hafs ‘An ‘Aasim, the recitation which is the most widely used one. There is also a facility for clearing doubts by sending emails and all the past queries are posted on the site so that others can benefit from them.

Best Feature:

An entire site dedicated to this very important science

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The site presents only text material. Adding audio lessons and interactive content in Flash etc would definitely benefit users.
28. King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Qur’an http://www.qurancomplex.org/?Lan=en

Rating 8/10

This has become a useful site, because of good quality translations of the Qur’aan in many languages, good quality recitations in the voice of four recitors, live feed and the option to download in MP3 and Real media format. It also has a small searchable fatwa database. The webmaster has combined all these in an easily navigable website thereby increasing its attraction.

Best Feature:

The recitations available for download and the translations.

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

Downloadable versions of the translations in languages other than English as these good translations are currently unavailable for download anywhere in cyberspace. Also some material on the history of compilation, miracles, authenticity of the Qur’aan would be apt.
29. Al Minbar.com http://www.alminbar.com/

Rating 8/10

This site represents the efforts of Shaikh Wajdi Hamzah Al Ghazzawi to make good quality authentic Khutbahs easily accessible to the Khuttab all around the world. For others the Khutbahs available on this site make for good reading material as articles. The research put up into preparing these khutbahs and the easy site navigation makes the site valuable.

Best Feature:

A huge database of khutbahs

What it lacks/ What could be added:

It would help if the editors would add references and authentication notes to all of the Ahadeeth mentioned in the Khutbahs. At present even references for all Ahadeeth are not provided. Also there is no other content but that is in keeping with the apparent aim of the site
30. Twelver Shia http://www.twelvershia.net/

Rating 8/10

This site focuses on refuting Shias through original articles and direct refutations to popular Shia websites. The site also contains an audio section and some translated books that focus on Shias as well. It also contains a discussion forum with a sub-section dedicated for ex-Shias.

Best Feature:

The nature of the refutations against Shias on the website is academic.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

A video section should be added to the website and the articles lack proper tagging which makes them hard to find.
31. Mahajjah http://mahajjah.com/

Rating 8/10

The website focuses on translating books against Shia propaganda. The original works are usually in Arabic and Urdu and are not accessible to those that are not literate in those languages.

Best Feature:

The books on the website contain exclusive English content that cannot be found anywhere else online.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The website does not have a social media presence, which is why much of the content is unknown to even those interested in the topics that have been covered on the website.
32. Nahjul Balagha http://nahjul-balagha.net/

Rating 8/10

The website is dedicated to refuting Shia propaganda through the book: Nahjul Balagha. Nahjul Balagha is a compilation of sermons that have been attributed to Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) and is seen by Shias as the second most important book after the Qur’an.

Best Feature:

A section dedicated to the examining the strength of each sermon through hadith criticism.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The website does not contain too much content since it is fairly new.
 

33. Islamtoday.com http://islamtoday.com/

Rating 7/10

A site run under the general supervision of Shaykh Salman al Oadah, it has many ebooks by him for download. Plus a Fatwa Section with archives and a facility to submit questions. Also of interest are th Hadeeth Showcase and Qur’aan showcase

Best Feature:

The Fatwa section as very few sites are able to accept questions nowadays and the Showcases.
34. Investigating Islam http://www.islamic.org.uk/

Rating 7/10

Here’s a good Da’wah site made with the western Christian in mind. It is a good site to refer to Christians who interested in comparative studies. It’s available in multiple languages & also has a Qur’aan search option and audios of the same

Best Feature:

Da’wah site oriented to the Western mind.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Audio/ video Da’wah lectures would be a welcome addition.
35. Sahaba.net http://www.sahaba.net

Rating 7/10

As is evident from its name, this site is dedicated to the Sahaba (radiAllaahu anhum). This site has a very modern look and an innovative design which the site maintainers have created using Flash. They have used their skills with Flash to create a flash e-book on the Sahaba which greatly enhances the cosmetic value of this site and also increases surfer interest. It is heartening to note that Muslims are not only keeping pace with modern media but are also using it for the propagation of Islaam.
The software for the Flash E book is also on sale for those interested in using it for their own sites etc.

Best Feature:

A site dedicated to the Sahaba and the excellent use of Flash to create a website and E book with a unique look. Also the site invites user participation by submitting stories and a forum.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Fits its name well but has a possibility of adding some classical and in depth works on the status of Sahaaba and importance of following their methodology etc.
36. Quran And Sunnah Society http://www.qss.org/

Rating 7/10

Surf to this site for safe, sound authentic Islaamic info. The site mentions that some sections are ‘Currently Under Development’ and also hopes to put up new online e-books & publications. Till then the quantity of material is not satisfying but the quality is very satisfying. Some Arabic lectures are also available here.

Best feature:

As far as I know this was the first site to put up the entire book on Salaah of Shaikh Albanee on-line and its still there. Other sites too have followed suit.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Quantity. And it is hoped that they do so soon because they seem have a knack for selecting good stuff.
37. Shariah Way http://www.shariahway.com/

Rating 7/10

The main agenda of the site is to serve New Muslims but has content relevant to all Muslims. This site is high on article content and maintained regularly with a regular mailing list. Each aspect of Islam has been covered. There are a few downloadable books but nothing that other sites don’t already have. An interesting feature is an Islamic quiz where you can test yourself on some of the basics of Islam. There are links to audio and Holy Quran radio, but nothing uploaded on the site

Best feature:

High on article content and authentic literature and an excellent site for new Muslims; not to forget the quiz!

What it lacks/ what could be added:

Site is not very user friendly and some of the colours can hurt the eyes. Improving the presentation of the site will attract more visitors and thus benefit more people.
38. Ahya.org http://www.ahya.org

Rating 7/10

This site has some really good articles which alone are worth the visit. Besides it has some good E books and one of them is their own publication
It has also has a sizeable collection of lectures. At the time of reviewing, the site had 31 lectures of Dr. Zakir Naik; mostly audio but video lectures are also available. Unfortunately not all are available for downloading

Best Feature:

A solid 31 Lectures of Dr. Zakir Naik and the articles.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

It has only 4 E books and lectures of only two speakers.
39. Islam Guide.com http://www.islam-guide.com/

Rating 7/10

This site consists of just a single book in the form of a website. However, it is worth visiting this site because it is an excellent book for Da’wah purposes or even for Muslims to strengthen their Faith by seeing the scientific proofs of the veracity of the Qur’aan. What adds luster to this site is that they allow you to download the entire book in PDF format for reading, printing and free distribution. A ‘Must Download’ for any Da’ee.
The site is also available in a few other languages.

Best Feature:

The book itself

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Although the apparent aim of the site maintainers (presenting the book on the net) is admirably accomplished it seems a waste to keep a website with such a good name for just this purpose. They would do well to add more such Dawah and comparative material.
40. Salafi Manhaj.com http://www.salafimanhaj.com

Rating 7/10

Here’s a site which holds the promise of jumping to higher ratings as time passes.
It already has a sizeable quantity of good material in the form of E books, fataawa and audio. But some of the sections are still devoid of content In our initial review we had noted with enthusiasm a project on Tafseer Ibn Kathir. But now it is no longer on the site.

Best feature:

Their E books and a well designed modern looking site.
Compared to other site in the top range the quantity & variety is low but projects seem underway to rectify this.
41. Salim Morgan’s site http://www.java-man.com/

Rating 7/10

This site has some good material not easily found elsewhere, namely the translation of some classical Arabic books into English. Unlike some other translations of Arabic books into English these are of good quality and make for smooth reading. See also (hear actually) an interesting audio of ‘some truly bizarre carrying-on which some people call “worship”.’

Best Feature:

The English translations of some classical Arabic books and lecture notes on some interesting topics

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

This is only a bare bones site so there is a lot of flesh that could be added. Also the site seems to have been neglected for a long time.
42. Gift2Shias https://gift2shias.com/

Rating 7/10

The website, which is run by ex-Shias, focuses on refuting Shia propaganda.

Best Feature:

A site dedicated to refutation of Shia propaganda.

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

The site contains a lot of very useful content, but lacks organization which makes some material hard to find.
43. Shia Scans https://shiascans.com/

Rating 7/10

A website that focuses on refuting Shia propaganda with scans from Shia books and brief commentaries.

Best Feature:

The webmasters have put in a lot of effort authenticating material by providing scans for the material.

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

The website does not contain too much content since it is fairly new.
44. Quraan.com http://www.quraan.com/

Rating 6/10

As the name indicates this site is primarily a site containing resources for the study of the Noble Qur’aan. It includes the complete translation by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan & T. Hilali.
Towards justifying its name it also has a Qur’aan research tool for registered users (free sign up) where in you can create your own bookmarks for ayah groupings under titles you choose, access the Arabic text. It has some additional good books about other topics

Best Feature:

MyQuraan Bookmarks for registered users which is a free service

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Going by its name it should have some Qur’aan software and audios to download which it doesn’t. The site maintainers would do well to add some material on the history of compilation of the Qur’aan, introduction to Usool at tafseer, proofs of authenticity etc.
45. Ibraheem’s Creed.net http://www.ibraheemscreed.net/

Rating 6.5/10

This is the website hosting the lectures of Shaikh Salem al Amry. It contains an excellent explanation of Kitaab at Tawheed of Imaam Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab. Besides this it also has other lectures. All lectures are in MP3 format and free to download. Make the best use of your MP3 players by downloading and listening to these lectures. Article content is low and E books are absent from this site.

Best Feature:

The series of lectures

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Material from other scholars, E books, articles.
46. Clearpath.com http://www.theclearpath.com

Rating 6/10

This is a site which aims to present a proper perspective of Islaam and the methodology Muslims should follow. For this it has some very good articles but the small number leaves much to be desired. It also contains a few books but has absolutely no audio content. Site navigation is easy and fast.

Best Feature:

Nothing outstanding but they have a good start to building a top class site.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Quantity
47. Islamic Web.com http://islamicweb.com/

Rating 6/10

This is one of the many sites on the net with everything in it good but such that it does not rise above the average. It has books, articles and a few audio and video lectures. All in all it is a good initial effort which needs to be improved on.

Best Feature:

Nothing outstanding.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

More and better quality content would boost the ratings of this site.
48. Jaafar Idris.com http://www.jaafaridris.com/

Rating 6/10

This site presents material of Shaikh Jaafar Idris. It’s a worth a visit to learn from the writings and lectures of this man.
There used to be a site earlier named ViewIslam.com which had the writings of Shaikh Jaafar Idris. But that seems to be down now.

Best Feature:

The works of Shaikh Jaafar Idri

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Quantity
49. Islamchannel.tv http://www.islamchannel.co.uk or http://www.islamchannel.tv

Rating 6/10

Visit this site to learn more about a praiseworthy effort on the part of Islam channel TV. The site describes the reason behind and the aim of the channel as:
Despite constituting one fifth of the world’s population, Muslims and Islam are currently misrepresented in the global media. This has led to a large demand amongst Muslims for television that reflects their needs and programmes that are founded upon Islamic values.
Islam Channel aspires to be an alternative channel; it will advance unbiased and accurate images of Islam and Muslims and endeavour to bring about cultural understanding and awareness for a peaceful and harmonious co-existence amongst communities.
Although I can’t comment on the quality of the actual programs of Islam Channel (I can’t access the channel and don’t have a broadband connection to view online) what I do feel is that there is a crying need for more such channels in the face of the current deluge of biased, misleading & negative misinformation on the international media scene. This effort needs to be supported by all Muslims, and not limited to only the few channels that are currently available world wide.
Besides the above information the site also tries to provide some good material for internet users. It has provided articles (mostly borrowed from other sites) and links to lectures from aswatalislam.net (see review for that site). As such there is no original content here.
It provides an online Fataawa facility wherein people can post questions on Islaamic issues. However the full list of scholars who will answer the questions is not available and there is no archive of past fataawa.

Best Feature:

The effort to maintain an ‘Islamic-focused satellite channel’ and the facility to view the channels programs live on-line.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The website would do well to put up some original content and an archive of past fataawa. Also it would be useful if they could add some downloadable video files of past good programs beamed on the channel.
50. Make Dua.com http://www.makedua.com/

Rating 6/10

A commendable effort by a group of volunteers. As they say: Fortification of the Muslim (Hisnul Muslim) is perhaps the most popular du’a book currently in print. This site is an electronic rendition of the “little du’a book”.
That’s what he site is. As this book is available as a Word and PDF download elsewhere on the net, this site would not have been of much use. However it has a alphabetical index by which you can search topics and jump straight to the required du’aa.

Best Feature:

The book itself

What it lacks/ What could be added:

The site could be developed into a resource centre on Du’aa in general with articles on the etiquettes of du’aas, times when they are accepted etc.
51. The Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah Association of Australia http://www.iisca.org/

Rating 6/10

Here’s a community site for Australian Muslims with good articles and audios. Apart from the articles, this site is relevant mostly for Australian Muslims.

Best feature:

A site catering to the Australian Muslim Community.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

E books, Multimedia content
Sites based on the Da’wah efforts of Shabbir Ally

52. http://islaminfo.com/new/

53. http://www.quranspeaks.com/main/

54. http://www.shabirally.com/

Rating 6/10

These are three partner sites and are centered around the Da’wah efforts of Shabbir Ally..

Best Feature:

The Da’wah efforts of Shabbir Ally

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Although the sites have a clean layout, the pages are understated which is a drawback on a Da’wah oriented site. Also more content would build on the usefulness of this site.
55. E Muslim.com http://www.emuslim.com/

Rating 6/10

Closely resembling www.understandquran.com is emuslim.com. Here too the main focus is on getting a better understanding the Qur’aan by means of the shortlist of words, dictionaries in various languages etc. It has some other articles too.

Best Feature:

80 % words of the Qur’aan and word to word dictionaries

What it lacks/ What could be added:

A good effort here which can be bettered by material on other aspects of the Qur’aan and Islaam.
56. Al Islam.com http://al-islam.com/eng/

Rating 6/10

Head here for the website of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Da‘wah and Guidance, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All in all it is a good start but it needs a lot more stuff to push it up the charts as till the time of reviewing it had only articles and some Qur’aanic recitations. It also has a good section devoted to Ahkam of Tajweed.

Best Feature:

A good section on Ahkam ut Tajweed.

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Content other than articles.
57.  Islamic garden.com http://www.islamicgarden.com/

Rating 5/10

A simple little website that covers the basics in Islam with a wide range of topics from Hijra to women’s issues. Each topic has a short introduction and the site owner has added a book to buy that will explain that topic in more detail. There are some good reviews of books on learning Arabic.
There is a good section on depression which is prevalent in our societies today. There is also a section that teaches you how to build an Islamic Web-Site and another on Inspirational true stories

Best feature:

The section on depression is informative .and the poetry section has some original poems

What it lacks/ What could be added:

More content added to each topic would add to the appeal of this small offering to the average Muslim surfer.
58. Islamcall.com http://www.islamcall.com/

Rating 5/10

A site geared towards Da’wah but nothing exceptional
59. Institute of Islamic Information and Education http://www.iiie.net

Rating 4/10

According to the site:
The Institute of Islamic Information and Education (III&E) is dedicated to the cause of Islam in North America through striving to elevate the image of Islam and Muslims by providing the correct information about Islamic beliefs, history and civilization from the authentic sources.
Apart from doing the above it has placed some very interesting brochures which are the reason for this site making it to this list and for Muslims apart from those residing in North America to visit it.

Best Feature:

Some interesting brochures

What it lacks/ What could be added:

Although basically meant for reflecting the activities of the III&E the webmaster should think of utilizing this valuable resource (the site) to put up more content to benefit all Muslims.
60. Real Islam.com http://www.realislam.com

Rating 4/10

This is one of the many sites which are based on correct sources and the presentation, content etc are about average.

Best feature:

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

Needs input all round of better quality material.
61. Muhammadiyah.org.sg http://www.muhammadiyah.org.sg/article.htm

Rating 3/10

Originally this site had some very good articles. Now it is under renovation, so the articles are not easily available directly from the home page but the link above will take you there. Some of the earlier articles seem to be missing. But hopefully the completed website should include all that and more. So keep this site in mind for visiting after a few months

Best Feature:

Nothing Outstanding

What it lacks/ What needs to be added:

As the site is under renovation it is best to watch and wait.
62. Sabbir.com http://www.sabbir.com/

Rating 3/10

The sole reason for this site to come on the list is the two projects undertaken by brother Sabbir viz.
1. An audio of the English Translation of the Qur’aan (Muhsin Khan and Hilali) along with the Arabic recitation by Shaikh Mishary ayah by ayah. Parts of it are already up on the site for free downloading. As far as we know this is the only site offering the audio version of the Muhsin Khan and Hilali translation.
2. The upcoming audio version of Riyadh us Saaliheen
The audios already up on the site are of professional So visit this site just for getting the audio translation files.

Best Feature:

Professional quality audio translation of the Qur’aan (partially completed)

What it lacks/ What could be added:

More material should be added to the Aqeedah section which has negligible content right now.
